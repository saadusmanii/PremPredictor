# Football Match Prediction Project
## Overview
This project is designed to predict the outcome of football matches, specifically focusing on the English Premier League (EPL). By scraping historical match data, the project analyzes patterns and uses machine learning techniques to forecast future results. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model based on past performances, team statistics, and other relevant factors.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Scraping**: Collect match data from [Fbref](https://fbref.com) using Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`.
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and format the scraped data for analysis. Handle missing values, normalize data, and convert categorical variables.
3. **Modeling**: Implement machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression or decision trees to predict match outcomes.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy of the predictions using metrics like precision, recall, and confusion matrices, and refine the model based on performance.

## Project Files
- `scraping.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook script to scrape, clean and prepare match data from online sources.
- `prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the model and making predictions.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saadusmanii/PremPredictor.git
cd PREMPREDICTOR
```

You can install these dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
